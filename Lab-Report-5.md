# Week 5 Lab Report


## My Favorite Activity
My favorite activity would be the competition to find and fix an error in code and then push it to github from the command line once finished. 
This was my favorite because it was a competition, and my competitive spirit caused me to both take it more seriously and find the most optimal solution.
Every other task, I just stopped the moment I got the thing to work and never optimized what I had.


## What I did in the Competition
While I was not the person on my team that finished it the quickest, as before the competition began we had to find the fastest person to be our team's "champion", I did help in optimizing the process.
So, I instead brainstormed ways to quickly write commands, as I noticed the place we were losing the most time on was the typing of commands. 
We then came up with the idea of pressing `<up>` to access previously used commands. While it's obvious in hindsight, it felt like a revelation in the moment.
After that, I went through each individual step carefully(with my team of course), trying to find even faster ways to do the tasks. 
One step in particular, being accessing nano to edit the java file, was focused on heavily, but we weren't able to come up with anything to do it faster without switching to a different program.
I don't remember much about the competition, but I do remember that our "champion" finished all the tasks in a bit over a minute, so it sounds like a success to me.

## Potentially Going faster
The easiest way of going faster would be to write a bash script. In the bash script, I would have just put the commands that we ended up using in the terminal. 
Of course, since we would be using a script, it would go many times faster. Since I am quite new to using bash and nano, however, I'm not sure exactly how to edit a file
through a bash script. But, if bash scripts were allowed, I am sure that I would have learned how to.
